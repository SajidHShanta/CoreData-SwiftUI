# CoreData-SwiftUI
this repository is my documentation for Core Data
# [Explore CoreData](ExploreCoreData/ExploreCoreData)
**CRUD** functions by learning how to Create, Read, Update, and Delete data within Core Data.
In addition to implementing the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions, we filter (predicate) Core Data fetch requests. We also properly delete Core Data relationships by using Deny, Cascade, and Nullify delete rules.

# [Core Data with MVVM](CoreDataWithMVVM/CoreDataWithMVVM)
Connect Core Data to our app using a ViewModel in MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel architecture). The main benefit of this method is that we can separate our code so that the code relating to updating Core Data is totally separate from the code relating to the View (the UI).

# [Core Data Relationships](CoreDataRelationships/CoreDataRelationships)
Create and manage multiple Core Data entities that have relationships between them. We develop a mock application that contains three types of entities: Businesses, Departments, and Employees. These entities will have many relationships between them, including one-to-one and one-to-many relationships!
